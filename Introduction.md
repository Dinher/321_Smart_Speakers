## Intoduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous trend which allows electronic devices to connect and communicate across networks. In of itself this connectivity increases the capabilities of these devices by increasing the resources it may draw from, update and maintain its internal software, as well as additional device or user specific data storage resource requirements. By the year 2020 an estimated 20 Billion devices may be communicating to each other requiring increased technology to maintain and improve the required infrastructure<sup>1</sup>. Recently, consumer electronics have leveraged this connectivity as and *added value* to the base functionality of the electronics such as; refrigerators being capable of re-ordering items exhausted within itsel, or smart televisions which connect to third party services to deliver alternative content than traditional cable/satellite subscription services.

With the current capabilities of Natural Language Processing and cloud computing *Smart Speakers* such as Amazon Echo or Google Home aim to act as a hub for these IoT devices. Primarily, the devices function through voice commands and are capable of controlling third party services or even other devices entirely through natural (ie. conversational) language<sup>2</sup>. This creates a incredibly intuitive and user-friendly interface which is becoming increasingly attractive to mainstream consumers.

Computer security has a particular stake in the realm of IoT but the specific nuances of Smart Speakers raise particular concerns as well. Many of these devices are a *black-box* of functionality which obfuscates the user data namely; how it's generated, what the data is, where it stored or is transmitted to, when the data is moved/created, and who are the stakeholders of the data.

Following are topics within the security of Smart Speakers which we will continue to explore and report:
1. The functionality of Smart Speakers and privacy concerns
2. Storage, ownership, privacy of user data
3. Legal and commercial consequences of Smart Speaker data leaks and company responses
4. Inferable user behavior from Smart Speaker network communication
5. Securing user privacy and associated middleware technologies
6. Future concernts, slippery slopes, and consumer protections
